## Introduction

This is a test post to verify the **Wabi-Sabi** theme.

### Typography Test

This is a paragraph with **bold text**, *italic text*, and `inline code`.

### Math Test

Here is an inline equation: $E = mc^2$.

And a block equation:

$$
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-x^2} dx = \sqrt{\pi}
$$

### Code Test

```python
def wabi_sabi():
    return "Imperfect, Impermanent, Incomplete"

print(wabi_sabi())
```

### Quote Test
